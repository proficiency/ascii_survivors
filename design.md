## Design
This document aims to outline aspects of the game's features. 

## Themes
* Medieval (grim)dark fantasy:
  * Skeletons, wizards, swords, goblins, and orcs
  * Magic and melee combat
  * Castles, dungeons, and... lore? 

## Gameplay
* Survivors-esque game with roguelike mechanics:
  * Exploration, combat, and resource management
  * Large, in-depth pool of items and upgrades
  * In-depth build identity and complexity, meaningful choices in upgrades
  * Diverse upgrades for spells, weapons, etc
  * Die once, your character's upgrades/stats are reset, apart from persistent ones
  * High difficulty regardless of the player's power level  
* 'Roguelite' persistence
  * upgrades and revives
  * Gold
  * Upgrades
  * Ruleset changes, modifiers, and quests
* Play with kb/m or gamepads
* Several simple but hand-crafted levels

## Visuals
* **ASCII graphics**
* Unique, subtle, and informative use of colors and glyphs. Including an in-game legend/key.
* Pleasing, simple, intuitive UI/UX

## [Sound](https://github.com/proficiency/ascii_survivors/issues/1)
Pleasing, cozy, fantasy sound effects and music. _todo._

## Code
Written in Rust using Bevy — the code is simple, documentation is light but meaningful, aiming to provide clarity without being overbearing.
* Efficient use of Bevy's [ECS](https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/)
* Lightweight, maintainable code
* Filesystem and modules designed with separation of concerns in mind
